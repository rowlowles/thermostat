To update Github repository 3 steps are required:
	change to the working directory
	git add . 
	git commit -m "message"
	git push origin master 



git diff    <<<  see changes I made line by line locally

git status  <<<  see the files I changed

git add .  <<< add all files to be commited in the local change log

git status  <<<  did it work ??

git commit -m "learning github with some basic changes"

	push  <<< push the change to the github cloud
	origin  <<<<  neededgit st when you have multiple git hub
